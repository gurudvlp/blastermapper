# Blaster Mapper
Level editor for the Blaster Master NES ROM.

You will need a copy of the Blaster Master ROM, which is not included.

This is an early alpha release.  It's mostly funcitonal, but some majorly needed functions are missing!

In a terminal, type:

```bash
./blastmap romfilename.nes

From here, you use the arrow keys to navigate.

Enter - Zoom in<br />
Escape - Zoom out/exit<br />
S - Save Rom to blasterout.nes<br />
C - Copy block<br />

Key pad 8 - Increase block id<br />
Key pad 2 - Decrease block id<br />
